# Fixes Applied - Cart Tax, Product Deletion, and Order Management Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Cart Tax Methods
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'SaleController' object has no attribute 'get_cart_tax_total'`

**Root Cause**: The enhanced cart widget was calling tax calculation methods that didn't exist in the SaleController.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `get_cart_tax_total()` method to SaleController
- Added `get_cart_total_with_tax()` method to SaleController
- Implemented proper tax calculation based on product categories
- Added support for cart-level discounts affecting tax calculations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/controllers/sale_controller.py` - Added missing tax calculation methods

### 2. Foreign Key Constraint Error Handling
**Error**: `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` when trying to delete products with sales

**Root Cause**: The database constraint error was occurring before the Python code could catch it and provide a proper error message.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced the `delete_product()` method to check for sales before attempting deletion
- Added proper exception handling for database constraint errors
- Improved error messages with step-by-step guidance
- Added fallback error handling for constraint violations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/controllers/product_controller.py` - Enhanced error handling in delete_product method

### 3. Missing Order Management Methods
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'SaleController' object has no attribute 'load_order_to_cart'`

**Root Cause**: The enhanced cart widget was calling order management methods that didn't exist in the SaleController.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `load_order_to_cart(order)` method to SaleController
- Added `complete_sale(user)` method to SaleController
- Implemented proper order loading with stock validation
- Added support for preserving original order prices
- Proper error handling for missing products or insufficient stock

**Files Modified**:
- `src/controllers/sale_controller.py` - Added missing order management methods

## Technical Details

### Cart Tax Calculation
```python
def get_cart_tax_total(self) -> float:
    """Calculate the total tax for the cart based on product categories."""
    total_tax = 0.0
    for cart_item in self.cart.values():
        product = cart_item.product
        if hasattr(product, 'category') and product.category:
            tax_rate = getattr(product.category, 'tax_rate', 0.0)
            item_total = cart_item.total  # After item discounts
            item_tax = item_total * (tax_rate / 100.0)
            total_tax += item_tax
    
    # Apply cart-level discount to tax calculation
    if self.cart_discount_percentage > 0 or self.cart_discount_amount > 0:
        cart_subtotal = self.get_cart_subtotal()
        cart_discount = self.get_cart_discount_total()
        discount_ratio = cart_discount / cart_subtotal if cart_subtotal > 0 else 0
        total_tax *= (1 - discount_ratio)
    
    return total_tax
```

### Enhanced Product Deletion Error Handling
```python
def delete_product(self, product_id: int) -> bool:
    """Delete a product by its ID with enhanced error handling."""
    try:
        # Check for sales BEFORE attempting deletion
        sales_count = self.session.query(sale_products).filter_by(product_id=product_id).count()
        
        if sales_count > 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Cannot delete product '{product.name}' because it is used in {sales_count} sales...")
        
        # Proceed with deletion
        self.session.delete(product)
        return safe_commit(self.session)
        
    except ValueError as e:
        raise e  # Re-raise for UI handling
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle database constraint errors
        if "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed" in str(e):
            # Provide better error message
            raise ValueError("Cannot delete product because it is referenced by other records...")
        return False
```

### Order Management Methods
```python
def load_order_to_cart(self, order) -> bool:
    """Load an order's items into the cart."""
    try:
        # Clear current cart first
        self.clear_cart()
        
        # Get order items
        order_items = order.get_order_items()
        
        # Add each item to cart with validation
        for item in order_items:
            product = item['product']
            quantity = item['quantity']
            
            # Check if product still exists and has sufficient stock
            current_product = self.session.query(Product).filter_by(id=product.id).first()
            if not current_product:
                logger.warning(f"Product {product.name} no longer exists")
                continue
            
            if current_product.stock < quantity:
                quantity = current_product.stock  # Use available stock
            
            if quantity > 0:
                cart_item = CartItem(current_product, quantity)
                cart_item.price = item['price']  # Preserve original price
                self.cart[current_product.id] = cart_item
        
        return True
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading order to cart: {e}")
        self.clear_cart()  # Clear cart on error
        return False
```

## Impact

### User Experience
- **Cart Functionality**: Users can now see tax calculations in the cart without errors
- **Product Deletion**: Clear error messages when products can't be deleted
- **Order Management**: Users can load orders into cart and complete sales
- **Better Guidance**: Users know exactly what to do when operations fail

### System Stability
- **Error Prevention**: Proper validation before database operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to work even when operations fail
- **Better Logging**: Improved error tracking and debugging
- **Data Integrity**: Stock validation prevents overselling

## Future Considerations

1. **Tax Rate Management**: Consider adding a global tax rate setting
2. **Bulk Operations**: Implement bulk delete for multiple products
3. **Audit Trail**: Add logging for all deletion operations
4. **Backup System**: Consider implementing soft deletes for critical data
5. **Order Synchronization**: Real-time order status updates
6. **Stock Alerts**: Notifications for low stock items

## Files Affected
1. `src/controllers/sale_controller.py` - Added tax calculation and order management methods
2. `src/controllers/product_controller.py` - Enhanced error handling
3. `src/ui/components/enhanced_cart_widget.py` - Now works with all methods
4. `src/ui/components/order_widget.py` - Can now load orders into cart

All fixes have been tested and are working correctly.
