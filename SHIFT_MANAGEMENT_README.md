## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:

- **Duplicate Shifts**: Prevents multiple open shifts
- **Invalid Amounts**: Validates opening amounts
- **Database Errors**: Handles database connection and transaction issues
- **User Cancellation**: Gracefully handles user cancellation of shift operations

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_shift_management.py`) has been created to verify:

- Shift opening and closing functionality
- Daily sales report generation
- Shift summary calculations
- Single shift policy enforcement
- Error handling scenarios

## Configuration

### Database Migration

Run the migration to remove the closing_amount column:

```bash
python src/migrate_remove_closing_amount.py
```

### Background Tasks

The daily reset task is automatically started with the application and runs continuously.

## Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All amounts are validated before processing
- **Transaction Safety**: Database operations use proper transaction handling
- **User Authentication**: Shift operations require proper user authentication
- **Data Integrity**: System ensures data consistency across operations

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries for reports
- **Background Processing**: Daily reset runs in background without blocking UI
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of resources and sessions
- **Scalability**: System designed to handle multiple users and shifts

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. **Historical Reports**: Extended date range reporting
2. **Export Functionality**: Export reports to Excel/PDF
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and forecasting
4. **Multi-location Support**: Support for multiple store locations

2. **"Failed to Open Shift" Error**:
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify user permissions
   - Check for system errors in logs

3. **Report Not Loading**:
   - Verify admin permissions
