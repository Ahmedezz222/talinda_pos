# Order Management System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart to Order Integration
**Problem**: When saving an order from the cart, it was not appearing in the active orders list simultaneously.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the `create_order()` method in `EnhancedCartWidget` to properly emit the `order_saved` signal
- Updated `MainWindow` to connect the `order_saved` signal to refresh the order management widget
- Added proper signal handling in `on_order_saved()` method

### 2. Order Controller Improvements
**Problem**: Order totals were not being calculated correctly when adding items to orders.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `_update_order_totals()` method in `OrderController` to properly calculate subtotal, discount, tax, and total amounts
- Fixed the `add_items_to_order()` method to use the new totals calculation
- Added session management improvements with `refresh_session()` method

### 3. Order Loading into Cart
**Problem**: Loading orders back into the cart was not working properly.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `load_order_to_cart()` method in `SaleController` to properly handle order items with their original prices
- Updated the `get_order_items()` method in the `Order` model to handle database sessions properly
- Improved error handling in order loading operations

### 4. Order Management Widget Refresh
**Problem**: The order management widget was not refreshing properly when new orders were created.

**Solution**:
- Added `force_refresh()` method to `OrderManagementWidget`
- Improved the `refresh_orders()` method to properly clear and rebuild order cards
- Added proper signal emission when orders are updated

### 5. Cart Widget Button States
**Problem**: Save Order and Checkout buttons were not being enabled/disabled based on cart contents.

**Solution**:
- Added `update_button_states()` method to `EnhancedCartWidget`
- Integrated button state updates with the `update_totals()` method
- Buttons are now properly enabled when cart has items and disabled when empty
