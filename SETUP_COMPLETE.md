## Troubleshooting

### If the application doesn't start:
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (must be 3.8+)
2. Verify database exists: `ls pos_database.db`
3. Check logs in `logs/` directory

### If login fails:
1. Verify credentials are correct
2. Check database connection
3. Look for error messages in logs

### If you need to reset:
1. Run setup again: `python setup_for_new_device.py`
2. Or use management commands: `python src/manage.py --help`

## Next Steps

1. **Configure your business** - Add products, categories, pricing
2. **Set up users** - Create additional cashiers and admins
3. **Customize settings** - Tax rates, business information
4. **Test the system** - Process test sales, generate reports
5. **Train users** - Show cashiers how to use the system
